# Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project

### Scraping 5000 Data Points Using Selenium, Data Cleaning, and MySQL Integration

---

## ðŸ“„ Project Description

In this project, I have scraped 5000 data entries from a website using **Selenium** and **Selenium WebDriver**. After successfully scraping the data, I performed **data cleaning** and **data manipulation** to prepare the dataset for analysis. The cleaned data was then stored in a **MySQL database** where I ran several **analytical queries** to gain insights from the dataset.
